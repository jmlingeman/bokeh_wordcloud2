# bokeh_wordcloud2
a (mostly complete) bokeh implementation of [wordcloud2-js](https://wordcloud2-js.timdream.org)

This was made as part of a learning project to make bokeh widgets, but it was too good not to share.

## Installation

`pip install https://github.com/joranbeasley/bokeh_wordcloud2.git`

## Documentation
docs are coming soon ... but for now check out the [examples](/examples)
